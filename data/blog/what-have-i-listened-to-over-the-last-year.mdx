> This project is inspired by the model work by [Anna Bode](https://annebode.medium.com/). See her stunning hands-on visualization tutorials [here](https://annebode.medium.com/).

## 1. Request the data

Request the data needed from Spotify [here](https://www.spotify.com/us/account/privacy/). Wait for a few days before you can get your hands on your data.

## 2. Prepare the data

Using the files that Spotify has given us, let's start create a dataframe that stores all our streaming history data. As my Spotify Library is rather limited, I do not include it in my project, as well as each song's specific URI. If you want to dive deeper into this visualization project, please follow the original article [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/visualizing-spotify-data-with-python-tableau-687f2f528cdd).

### - Import the libraries

```Python
import panda as pd
import numpy as np
```

### - Create streaming history dataframe

```python
df_stream = pd.read_json('StreamingHistory0.json')
df_stream.head()
```

![df_stream.head()](/static/images/spotify/1.png)

### - Create a `uniqueID` identifier for each song, which we will use later in Tableau.

```python
df_stream['uniqueID'] = df_stream['artistName'] + ': ' + df_stream['trackName']
```

### - Convert to local time

As the `endTime` provided in the dataset is in the UTC time zone, we need to convert it to our local time. (Modify the code according to your preference).

```python
time_difference = 7
df_stream['endTime'] = pd.to_datetime(df_stream['endTime'])
df_stream['endTime_local'] = df_stream['endTime'] +
                             pd.to_timedelta(time_difference, unit='h')
```

### - Finally, convert `msPlayed` to `minutesListened`

```Python
df_stream['minutesListened'] = df_stream['msPlayed'] / 60000
```

![minutesListened](/static/images/spotify/4.png)

### - Drop unnecessary columns and save to csv file

```Python
df_stream.drop(['endTime', 'msPlayed'], axis = 1, inplace = True)
df_stream.to_csv('StreamingDataSpotify.csv')
```

## 3. Load the data into Tableau

- Connect to your csv file (StreamingDataSpotify.csv) as a data source. Remember to drop/hide the first column, which is the initial index column in the DataFrame (or you can drop the index column when save to csv file by using `index = False` argument).

- Then click on the first sheet and start visualizing the data!

## 4. Visualize the data

### - Top Artists

- Most popular artists by minutes listened, with individual songs making up colorful segments.

### - Artist Breadth

- Number of songs by each artist Iâ€™ve listened to for >1 minute and >1 stream.

![artists_breadth](/static/images/spotify/tableau3.png)

- Sort the **Artist Name** by distinct count of **Track Name** in descending order to achieve the final look.

### - Top Songs

- Most popular songs by minutes listened.

![top_songs](/static/images/spotify/tableau4.png)

- Sort the **Unique ID** by sum of **Minutes Listened** in descending order to achieve the final look.

### - Listenership by Month

- Total number of minutes listened by each month throughout the year.

![listener_month](/static/images/spotify/tableau5.png)

### Listenership by Hour

- Total number of minutes listened at each hour timeframe.

## 5. Final dashboard and some insights

![dashboard](/static/images/spotify/tableau7.png)

- The track that I listened to most is **Rain in Forest White Noise | Sleep, Study or Focus to Rainstorm in 8 hours** produced by **Relaxing White Noise** channel. Actually, I'm always a big fan when it comes to productive-working methods and listening to white noise is not an exception. It was only after I subscribed to Spotify premium and my work and study happened entirely on the Internet that I started to listen to this channel more than ever.
- **Ha Anh Tuan** and **Son Tung M-TP** are the top two artists, having many tracks that I spent most of the time listening to. They are local artists and are highly popular in my country. **Dua Lipa** actually has many tracks that I often repeatedly listened to during lockdown and **ABBA's Dancing Queen** is always on repeat.
- January, 2020 was the time our traditional Tet holiday takes place and I didn't have to go to school, I have more time to listen to music. April was when I attended a three-week military camp as a compulsory course in the university's curriculum, I only carried my phone so Spotify, with other games and entertainment apps, were indispensible. October was when I had the chance to subscribe to Spotify Premium under Student Plan. No more advertisement, I could enjoy the music more comfortably.
- 9 o'clock in the morning and after 9 at night were the time that I found myself most productive. And listening to music while studying/working at these times has been my habit over the last year.
