> This project is done with MySQL Server and Arctype - A GUI SQL Editor. You can find out more at [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) to setup MySQL Server and use MySQL Workbench as a default SQL Editor; or [Arctype](https://arctype.com/) to have some fun with Arctype.

## Project Description

- You are working with a local museum. The museum is about to launch a new interactive application on Roman emperors and your job is to prepare the data that it will display.
- The museumâ€™s database has a table, named `roman_emperors`, with basic information on all emperors who ruled from 1 AD onwards. You will need to clean the data before the app can launch.
- Your query will need to return a table that contains the following columns (with the given alias) and meets the specified requirements. You will use the data contained in the `roman_emperors` table.

### Project Requirements

### Short name and Full name

- With this task, we can simply use `LOWER()` and `UPPER()` function from mySQL. As the name of the emperors should be unique, we should add `DISTINCT` statement following `SELECT` statement.

### Birthplace

- You can accomplish this requirement with a simple `CASE-WHEN` statement, though it's not so efficient. We will check if each of the two column `birth_city` and `birth_province` `IS NULL` or not, then use `CONCAT()` function to join the two column.

### Age

- This requirement requires nested functions to, **first**, convert the initial data in `death` and `birth` columns (original data type is varchar) to datetime value, extract the YEAR value from the converted data, perform calculation, **then** use `COALESCE()` function to return the suitable result.
- First we have `STR_TO_DATE()` function to convert a string to a datetime value, date format should be specified as an argument. In this case, we will simply need `YEAR-MONTH-DAY` value.

### Reign

- Same step should be applied to `reign_end` and `reign_start` columns to get the `reign` value.

### Cause of Death

- Simple `CASE-WHEN` statement will solve the problem. Note that we will subset only five specific values **Assassination, Natural Causes, Execution, Died in Battle and Suicide.**

### Era

- Another `CASE-WHEN` statement! We could use the same way as in Age and Reign columns to extract the `YEAR` value, then make comparisons to get appropriate results.

  > Remember to sort the `NAME` column by ascending order just simply by using `ORDER BY` statement.

## Final result

**If you do it correctly, we'll have a table ready for the museum app launch!**

Here is the final code:

And the final table (truncated)!
